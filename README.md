# Very-simple-terminal-Calculator
This is a Project where I set myself the goal of making a simple terminal calculator in python.
I decided to upload it on Github, because I thought it might be a great idea to introduce myself to Github 
and have the abillity to call for help, if needed.

Licens will be added, as soon as i know which one to choose...
